<h2>Learning 📚</h2>

<p align="center">This project was really nice to develop. I was capable to understand much better how the back-end works, how to use asyncronous requisitions, database connection, CRUD functionalites, how to save sessions, create users, pagination and a lot of other things. I'm liking so much this area and also front-end, so maybe I'll be a full-stack developer, I guess haha. 🙌🏼 </p>

<h2>Installation 👨‍💻</h2>

### Before you can start, you have to install this tools in your machine:

- <b>[Git](https://git-scm.com)</b>
- <b>[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)</b>

### Then:

```
- Clone the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/ggonpereira/techlune-crud-blog.git

- Then access the directory:
$ cd techlune-crud-blog

- Now you'll have to create a new database (I recommend this name: "techlune")

- And create a ".env" file in the root directory with this followings infos:
DB_NAME=NAME_OF_DATABASE
DB_HOST=HOST_OF_DATABASE
DB_USER=USER_OF_DB_ADMIN
DB_PASS=PASS_OF_DB_ADMIN
SECRET_PHRASE=LITERALLY_ANYTHING

- And go to "/models/" and remove the comment where says "_____.sync({ force: true });" from "Article.js", "Category.js" and "User.js"

- Then, type:
$ npm i

- And:
$ npm start

- When the server is started you can comment again the lines you've removed the comment before and restart the server

- And finally, access: http://localhost

```
